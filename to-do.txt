Still to do before happy with complete project:

Frontend:
- Loading animations/states cleaned up
- Ensure user experience/flow is nailed
- Sort out the double loading problem with /jobs

Backend
- Potentially better extraction for contact info/name of user but not a must as they have manual oversight

General
- Sort out a organised well thought out readme
- Use Claude as an oversight to any potential errors I have somehow not spotted/best practices etc.
